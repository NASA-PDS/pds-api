PDS Search API User Guide
=========================

The Planetary Data System is a federated system of nodes that archive planetary science data. The PDS Application Programming
Interface (API) is an attempt at provide a consistent interface for sharing archival data and services across PDS, among
planetary archives, and within the planetary science community. The API is one of the cornerstone applications for providing an
integrated worldwide data services platform that enables the efficient discovery, dissemination, use and analysis of internationally sponsored planetary science archives.

The PDS Search API provides end-points to search for bundles, collections and any PDS products with advanced search queries.
It also enables to browse the archive hierarchically downward (e.g. collection/s products) or upward (e.g. bundles containing products).

This site provides a user guide for the PDS Search API.
