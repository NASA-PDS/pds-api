PDS APIs
========

The Planetary Data System (PDS) is a federated system of nodes that archive planetary science data.

The PDS Application Programming Interface (API) provides a consistent way for planetary science community to discover and
share archival data across PDS. This API is one of the cornerstone applications for providing an integrated worldwide
data services platform that enables the efficient discovery, dissemination, use and analysis of internationally sponsored
planetary science archives.

PDS is willing to develop ReST-ful web APIs for different applications (so far, registry, dois).

These pages document how to access these APIs.

This web site is also available as a `PDS document <./_static/pdsapis.pdf>`_
