# Packaging Information
# =====================
#
# This is the Planetary Data System's template for packaging information of
# Python packages. After making a copy of the template repository, go through
# this file *carefully* and fill in sections, change settings, etc., as
# needed for your particular project. Look for the ``TODO`` indicators as
# well as the comments sprinkled throughout, and replace obvious strings
# like ``your_pckage_name`` and ``A short descriptionâ€¦``.
#
#
# Metadata
# --------
#
# Fill in your package metadata here in order to give "window shoppers"
# information about the package, whether they can use it and should use
# it, and how to get it.

# Options
# -------

# The options here describe the morphology of the package, such as the
# packages it depends on, namespaces, and so forth.

# Change this to False if you use things like __file__ or __path__â€”which you
# shouldn't use anyway, because that's what ``pkg_resources`` is for ðŸ™‚

# Coverage Testing
# ----------------
#
# The ``coverage`` tool helps ensure that all parts of your code is actually
# used. The settings here tell what files we can skip. Feel free to adjust
# this.
#
# See https://coverage.readthedocs.io/ for more.

# Pytest
# ------
#
# Pytest is the modern way to run all sorts of tests in code. It works with
# the ``unittest`` module in the Python Standard Library and also offers its
# own shortcuts to simplifying writing and running tests.
#
# See https://docs.pytest.org/ for more information.

# Flake8
# ------
#
# Flake8 (pronounced "flay-kate") is a Python style guide tool. It checks your
# code against a library of "best practices" for writing Python and lets you
# know when things aren't quite the "best". There are numerous options below
# and you can read more about the tool at https://flake8.pycqa.org/

# E203 prevents flake8 from complaining about whitespace around slice
# components. Black formats per PEP8 and flake8 doesn't like some of
# this.
#
# E501 prevents flake8 from complaining line lengths > 79. We will use
# flake8-bugbear's B950 to handle line length lint errors. This trips
# when a line is > max-line-length + 10%.

# B***: Specific flake8-bugbear opinionated warnings to trigger
#   B902: Invalid first argument used for method. Use self for instance
#       methods, and cls for class methods
#   B903: Use collections.namedtuple (or typing.NamedTuple) for data classes
#       that only set attributes in an __init__ method, and do nothing else.
#   B950: Line too long. This is a pragmatic equivalent of pycodestyle's
#       E501: it considers "max-line-length" but only triggers when the value
#       has been exceeded by more than 10%.

# mypy
# ----
#
# ``mypy`` checks your use of type annotations in modern Python code, similar
# to compile-time type checking in statically typed languages. This helps
# detect errors early instead of at run-time where they're much harder to
# debug.
#
# For more information about ``mypy``, see: https://mypy.readthedocs.io/

[mypy]
# The generic ``mypy`` settings are blank for now, but there are more specific
# options below. Note that the section syntax for ``mypy`` includes
# glob-style wildcards to match file patterns.

# Versioneer
# ----------
#
# Versioneer handles automatically determining the version number of your
# Python package by examining ``git`` tags and history.
#
# See https://github.com/python-versioneer/python-versioneer for more.
