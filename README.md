# API Documentation 

The API Documentation is available at: https://nasa-pds.github.io/pds-api/

We also publish [a draft of the PDS API Specification](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16d0MVh48bFLvWsa5-B_Hy-cby1rGWdnNojWOJpUcOvA/edit#heading=h.3pbz9ppxrxvr).


# Generate Postman Test Collection

Postman is a popular tool to make web API testing more user friendly: https://www.postman.com/

Postman is a standalone desktop application that you first need to [download and install](https://www.Postman.com/downloads/).

To create a test collection for the PDS federated API, the steps are:

1.  Go to import (top-left)
2.  Choose 'Link' tab
3.  Use link `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NASA-PDS/pds-api/main/json-unresolved/swagger.json`
4.  In settings, for request parameter generation, select `Example`, this will assign example values to the API arguments. If you select `Schema` no value will be assigned.
5.  Create a virtual environment: click the wheel on top-right, then 'Add'
6.  Create constant `baseUrl` and assign value of your root server without trailing `/`, for example `https://pds-gamma.jpl.nasa.gov/api`
7.  Make sure your new environment is selected, use top-right drop down menu.
8.  In the left menu, go to your new collection folder named `Planetary Data System API`, select a request.
9.  Adjust the request's parameters and hit `Send`
10. You can extend the collection by duplicating and editing existing requests
 
‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning:** if you reimport the same specification in the same folder, your manually set parameters will be lost.
